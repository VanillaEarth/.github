Vanilla Earth is a 1:500 sized Earth Map SMP where you can build, socialize, and have fun!

For us, the player experience is will always be the number one priority, and we will try our hardest to give you the best experience possible while playing on our server.


## The VE Experience

In comparison to our common place competition, we open the door to new never before seen gameplay. Our content is made from scratch, with hours of hard work put in from our writers, artists, and developers. We also offer completely original written events that occur in the server, each one with its own original story and in game quests to complete it! With talented in house developers, artists, as well as the funding and environment to back it up, the possibilities are endless, and everything we add is bound to pique your interest.
