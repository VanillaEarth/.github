Vanilla Earth is a 1:500 sized Earth Map SMP where you can build, socialize, and have fun! With almost 2 years of experience starting from just a simple realm, to where we are now. We have come a very long way to give the players an absolutely flawless server experience when it comes to Earth replicated SMP's. The player's experience is number one priority for us always, and we will try our hardest to give you the best experience possible while playing on our server.

## The VE Experience

In comparison to our common place competition, we open the door to new gameplay which has never before seen, because our content is formulated by the active staff team to create an original new idea every time we add something new. We also offer completely original written events that occur in the server, each one with its own original story and in game quests to complete it! With talented in house developers, the possibilities are endless, and everything added is bound to peak anyone's interest.
